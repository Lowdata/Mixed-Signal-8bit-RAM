Computing in the modern day is about speed, and we all know that **_SRAM's are much faster than DRAM's_**, also memory elements have their importance in storing the large chunks of data. But web applications and server based systems **_need high storage and high speed._** For that there is the concept of caching. **_In caching we store the data at the first load and due to saving this the load time of consecutive load decreases_**. **_SRAM's_** have **_low memory storage but faster access speed and low power consumptions_**. So for the purpose of caching we use SRAM's. As the consumptions of computers is increasing every year SRAM's consumption will be drastically increasing over over the time. So we are going to design a 8-bit SRAM based cache memory which is mainly used for the fast speed and low power in comparison with DRAM.
As presented in the _Fig.1_ we will be working with a **_series of 8-bit RAM cells and the RAM cell_** whose bit value needs to be modified needs to be selected by the decoder. The decoder circuit will be implemented in the digital domain using **_NgVeri_** and the 1-bit RAM cell will be implemented in analog domain using **_eSim_** at transistor level. Each **_1-bit RAM will have a writer circuit, a 8T RAM cell and a sensory circuit._**
